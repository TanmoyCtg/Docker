What is Docker?

<p>Before understand docker you need to understand hypervisor. What the heck? Hypervisor! I know hypervisor dude! Ok but this is for who don't know hypervisor. Imagine, You have a computer.You are using windows os. Your computer configuration is core i3, ram 4gb and harddisk space is 1tb. Now you want to use Linux for your OS lab assignment. How you solove this problem. You should use virtualbox or kvm or vagrant. In your vitualbox you install ubuntu 14.04 and you give 20gb space from 1tb your single hardware and you also share 2 gb ram or 1gb ram. see now virtualbox taking your single hardware resources. now you thought that you should use kali linux. so you need another virtualbox. again select resources from your single hardware resources.   </p>

## SO hypervisor is a program which is managing lots of os(windows, linux, mac) in your virtualbox and hypervisor uses your single hardware resources.
